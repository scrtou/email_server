## Completed Tasks

* [2025-06-08 14:57:23] - Implemented frontend UI for initiating the OAuth2 flow.
  * Added an "Add Email Account" button in `EmailAccountListView.vue` that opens a modal.
  * The modal allows users to select an OAuth provider (Google/Microsoft).
  * Clicking a provider button redirects the user to the corresponding backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/oauth2/connect/google`).
  * Implemented callback handling in `App.vue` to display success or error notifications based on URL query parameters (`status=success` or `status=error`) after the user returns from the provider.
* [2025-06-08 14:53:25] - Implemented backend API endpoint for initiating OAuth2 flow.
  * Added `RedirectToOAuthProvider` handler in `src/backend/handlers/oauth2.go`.
  * Created a placeholder for `HandleOAuth2Callback` handler.
  * Registered `GET /api/oauth2/connect/:provider` and `GET /api/oauth2/callback/:provider` routes in `src/backend/main.go`.
* [2025-06-08 14:51:43] - Created database migration for OAuth2 feature.
  * Created `OAuthProvider` and `UserOAuthToken` GORM models.
  * Added new models to `AutoMigrate` to ensure table creation.
* [2025-06-08 11:15:45] - Implemented backend for email inbox feature.
  * Added `go-imap` dependency.
  * Created `Email`, `EmailAddress`, `Attachment` models.
  * Implemented `imap_client` to fetch emails.
  * Added `GetInbox` API handler.
  * Registered `/api/v1/inbox` route.

* [2025-06-08 11:19:10] - Implemented frontend for email inbox feature.
  * Added `dompurify` dependency.
  * Created `inbox.js` store.
  * Created `InboxView.vue` and `EmailDetailView.vue`.
  * Created `EmailListItem.vue` and `AttachmentList.vue` components.
  * Added `getInboxEmails` to `api.js`.
  * Added inbox routes to `router/index.js`.
* [2025-06-08 11:36:44] - Performed security review of the email inbox feature.
  * Backend: Verified secure handling of credentials. Attachment handling not implemented.
  * Frontend: Confirmed XSS protection with DOMPurify. Attachment download not implemented. Verified API calls are authenticated.
## Current Tasks

* [2025-06-08 14:55:37] - Implemented OAuth2 callback handler.
  * Completed logic in `HandleOAuth2Callback` in `src/backend/handlers/oauth2.go`.
  * Added state validation, token exchange, and user info retrieval.
  * Implemented secure token encryption and storage in `user_oauth_tokens` table.
  * Refactored `encryption.go` to support generic data encryption.
  * Added required `golang.org/x/oauth2` dependencies.
 
 * [2025-06-08 15:07:00] - Integrated OAuth2 into the IMAP client.
   * Modified `src/backend/integrations/imap_client.go` to support both password (PLAIN) and OAuth2 (XOAUTH2) authentication.
   * The client now checks for a `UserOAuthToken` in the database for a given email account.
   * If a token is found, it uses the `XOAUTH2` mechanism. This includes logic to refresh expired access tokens using the refresh token.
   * If no token is found, it falls back to the existing password-based authentication.
   * Added `github.com/emersion/go-sasl` dependency to handle the `XOAUTH2` SASL mechanism.

 **Task: Refactor and Optimize Inbox Feature**
**Date:** 2025-06-08
**Summary:**
Completed a major refactoring of the email inbox feature to improve performance and maintainability.

**Backend (Go):**
- Implemented pagination in `integrations/imap_client.go` by adding `page` and `pageSize` parameters to the `FetchEmails` function.
- Removed hardcoded IMAP server address, making it configurable per `EmailAccount` by adding `IMAPServer` and `IMAPPort` to the model.
- Updated `handlers/email.go` to support pagination queries and return total email count.

**Frontend (Vue):**
- Implemented infinite scrolling (lazy loading) in `views/InboxView.vue`.
- Updated the `stores/inbox.js` Pinia store to manage paginated state (`page`, `pageSize`, `totalEmails`, `hasMore`).
- Modified `utils/api.js` to pass pagination parameters to the backend.
- Ensured loading and error states are clearly displayed to the user.

**Status:** Completed and verified.
- [2025-06-08 11:41:12] - START - Update README.md with new "Inbox" feature documentation.
- [2025-06-08 11:41:43] - END - Update README.md with new "Inbox" feature documentation.
- [2025-06-08 11:43:33] - START - Final system integration check for Inbox feature.
- [2025-06-08 11:43:33] - END - Final system integration check for Inbox feature. Found and fixed issue with email detail view routing (using MessageID instead of ID). System is now fully integrated.
