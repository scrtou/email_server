**Current Focus:** Finalizing Inbox Feature Integration.

**Status:**
- The final system integration check for the "Email Inbox" feature is complete.
- A critical integration issue was identified and resolved: The application was incorrectly using a numeric `id` for email detail routing, whereas the IMAP-based backend provides a string-based `MessageID`.
- The fix involved updating the frontend Pinia store (`inbox.js`), the list item component (`EmailListItem.vue`), and verifying the detail view (`EmailDetailView.vue`) to consistently use `MessageID`.
- All backend and frontend components are now correctly integrated.
- The end-to-end user flow for viewing the inbox and email details is conceptually sound.
- The Memory Bank (`progress.md`) has been updated to reflect the completion of this task.

**Next Steps:**
- The project is ready for final delivery or handoff.
