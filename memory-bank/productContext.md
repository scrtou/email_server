## Project Goal

*   

## Key Features

*   **OAuth2-based Authentication**: Integrate with third-party OAuth2 providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft) to allow users to connect their email accounts without storing their passwords directly. This enhances security and user trust.

## Overall Architecture

*   The architecture will be updated to support a dual-authentication system, where users can choose between traditional password-based login and the new OAuth2 flow. A new set of handlers and database tables will be introduced to manage OAuth2 tokens and provider configurations.
